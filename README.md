# COVID-19-X-Ray-Detector
COVID-19 has caused a devastating effect on daily 
lives, public health, and the global economy. 
It is critical to detect the positive cases as early as 
possible to prevent the further spread of this 
pandemic and to quickly treat affected patients. 
The need for auxiliary diagnostic tools has increased 
as there are no accurate automated toolkits available.

<br>Recent findings obtained using radiology imaging 
techniques suggest that chest X-ray images contain 
salient information about the COVID-19 virus.
Therefore here in this project we have created an 
image classifier with Tensorflow by implementing 
CNNs to differentiate between chest X-ray images 
with a COVID-19 infections versus without.


## Tools Used
- Project was build using GOOGLE COLAB
- TensorFlow and Matplotlib are some of prominent libraries used
- A pre trained Convolutional 
Neural Networks are used to 
train the model
